# MyCMS
This is a CMS build with PHP, MySQL and Bootstrap

It's a very basic CMS and I will keep on updating MyCMS.

You can use this CMS for your project.
The DBSCRIPTS folder has the mysql scripts to create the Database. I have some random data with that, so you can remove that.

I am using XAMPP for development and I am using port 8080 for Apache and 3306 for mysql for the same. So if you find any trouble related to port just change it the one you are using.
